Here's a bit more about tea and its benefits:\n\n- **Green Tea**: Known for its high antioxidant content, particularly catechins, which may contribute to heart health and weight management. A study published in the *Journal of the American College of Nutrition* found that green tea can increase metabolic rate and fat oxidation in the short term [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18326618).\n\n- **Black Tea**: Contains flavonoids that might help in reducing the risk of stroke and heart disease. Research from *Stroke* journal indicates that regular consumption of black tea can lower the risk of ischemic stroke [2](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.109.559951).\n\n- **Herbal Teas**: Varieties like chamomile or peppermint can have soothing effects. Chamomile, for instance, has been studied for its potential to improve sleep quality, as noted in a study in the *Journal of Advanced Nursing* [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2009.05222.x).\n\nSo, go ahead and enjoy your tea! Just remember to keep an eye on caffeine intake if you're sensitive to it or if it's late in the day. Which type of tea are you leaning towards?\n\nReferences:\n[1] Dulloo, A.
